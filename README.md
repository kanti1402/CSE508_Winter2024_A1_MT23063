This repository is dedicated to storing the materials for Information Retrieval (IR) Assignment 1, which comprises three questions. 
The focus of Question 1 is on Data Preprocessing, involving five essential steps:

1. Converting the text to lowercase.
2. Breaking the text into tokens.
3. Eliminating common stopwords.
4. Removing punctuation.
5. Getting rid of space tokens.

Moving on to Question 2, our task involves creating a Unigram Inverted Index from scratch. Additionally, we've developed functionality to handle boolean queries provided by users. The supported boolean operations include AND, OR, AND NOT, and OR NOT. This section showcases our work in constructing a robust unigram inverted index and implementing boolean query processing.

Question 3 brings us to the creation of a Positional Index and the handling of Phrase Queries provided by users. This segment demonstrates our commitment to enhancing the retrieval capabilities, ensuring precision in handling complex queries involving phrase structures.
